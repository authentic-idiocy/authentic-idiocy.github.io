      <summary>Who had the f***ing time to say all that to begin with?</summary>
      <div class="back">
        <p>Ofc the French, who frown upon people who work through lunch. 
          And who needed a slew of synonyms to describe fin-de-siècle Decadence (see also ennui, blasé) before the word got appropriated

        <em>insouciant</em> “carefree,” built from
        <em>in-</em> (“not”) + <em>souciant</em> (“troubled”),
        and bringing it all the way back to Latin <em>sollicitus</em> “anxious.”</p>
