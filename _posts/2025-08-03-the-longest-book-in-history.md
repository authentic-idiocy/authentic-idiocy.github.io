        <li>Title of post = 1st line of Marcel Proust's absolute unit of a <span class="define" data-def="no, that's fake news. A 7-book series is a heptalogy. Thanks, JK Rowling for the correction.">septology: </span> <em>À la recherche du temps perdu</em></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Or I guess if you are <span class="define" data-def="Literal translation: A stinky American">un américain puant</span>, <em>Rembrance of Things Past (alt. In Search of Lost Time)</em> </li>
          <li>So the whole <span class="define" data-def="Longtemps, je me suis couché de bonne heure, in Francais, for the blue-bloods.">'early to bed'</span> quote is also the 1st line of the 1st volume, <em><span class="define" data-def="Swann's Way. But c'mon, doesn't the French read so much fancier?!">Du côté de chez Swann</span></em></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Proust shat these 7 bad boys out over the course of 14 years, from 1913 to 1927.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Correction: 11 years, since the last 3 were published after he died (I'm going to say, of dysentary).</li>
          <li>1.2M words, 4.2K pages, the longest novel on Earth now just spliced into tokens for o3-pro (or whatever tf they're on now).</li>

        <li>No lie. It's the time-travel mechanism throughout this monstrosity. He calls them <span class="define" data-def="Involuntary memories for the crude. I just call them cringe moments.">mémoire involontaires</span></li>
